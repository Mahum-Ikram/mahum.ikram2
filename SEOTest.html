      "transcript": "Hello, and welcome back everyone to another exciting episode of book reviews by Kanuth. We'll be reviewing the book which is one of the most celebrated books in the world, Harry Potter and the Order of the So when we talk about order of the phoenix, it installment in JK Rowling's celebrated series, which delves into the complexities of the magical world of Harry Potter and his fellow friends, which we generally know as Ron and Hermione. In this book, we find more of Harry's friends such as Janeer, Luna, and Neville and so on. And so this plot basically describes it, opens up, and then develops the character of Harry and his friends even more and if the strength and the bond that they share and how Harry's life evolves in this exciting series is what we are going to be discussing in a bit. So as you can see, we have the Hogwarts logo at the background. Everybody loves it. Absolutely who anybody who is, you know, a potter head whether you're a you're going to be loving it. And let me just, you know, add another bit of an image from the same, uh, same book or you can say the movie of Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix in which you can see Harry, Ron, and Hermione having some kind of an intense moment. And as you dive into the pages of the book, you'll find Harry grappling with the aftermath of the return of lord Voldemort, which we saw in the end of, uh, the goblet of fire where lord Voldemort emerged, and the wizarding world was in denial. They're still in denial. The ministry of magic is determined to discredit Harry and Dumbledore, and they're basically creating a climate of fear and suspicion. And in this darker world, Harry has become or Harry has emerged as a more mature, you know, leader. He is basically not only facing external threats, but also he is struggling internally. And one of the most striking elements of this book is the introduction of Dolores Umbridge. So professor Umbridge is one of the most evil characters. You're undoubtedly going to love or hate her, however that is going to turn out, but she gives some some of the most cruel punishments. One of the punishments she gave Harry was to write from a quill, which did not take in any ink, rather it took Harry's blood, and he had to write down that I must not tell lies, where Harry is not the liar, basically. So this is the kind of dangerous threat that he is, um, exposed to outside of the school as well as inside of the school and the detention scenes in particular are really intense and they're an important part of the story. So moving on, if we talk about more aspects of this book, we're going to find Dumbledore's army, which is one of the highlights, which showcases the strength of friendship and the resilience of the younger generation. Generation, Harry's role here emerges as a leader where he comes to the forefront, and you'll be appreciating the similar characters of Hermione, Ron, Neville. They're stepping up and showing their bravery. So this is the brighter side of the book that we really like and viewers or, you know, readers anticipate this kind of moment since the very beginning. I have also added another image in which you can see that this train, which is leading to Hogwarts, these are one of the most scenic views that we see in the movies. So this was one thing to add up over here. Let's talk more about the book. So this book basically explores the themes of authority, rebellion, and the importance of truth and justice. So Rowling's writing is as engaging as ever. It's pulling you into a world she has meticulously crafted. And the department of, uh, mystery sequence is thrilling, imaginative, filled with, you know, unexpected twists and emotional punches. You'll be on a roller coaster ride and you'll never get bored. However, what basically sets this book apart is its emotional depth, Harry's grief and anger over Sirius Black's fate, his frustration with being kept in the dark, and his sense of isolation, they're beautifully portrayed in the book. These emotions basically make him and the story more relatable and more compelling in the sense that it couldn't have been the same if Rowling had wrote it in some other way. So, basically, it really changes the whole perspective for the readers, and it becomes even more interesting. So there's also an interesting image that I've shared. There's a kind of a leaky cauldron. You can see there's something cooking. The potions are being made, and these are some of the most ins uh, you know, exciting things about Harry Potter that we see. Uh, you know, even young adults would love it or teenagers would love it, but also grown up mature people also like it. In their thirties or forties, they enjoy Harry Potter reading it and also watching the movies. So let's move back to the book. Let's talk a bit about the conclusion of the book, which sets the stage for the final battles to come, which basically leaves us eager to know how the story will unfold and how Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix will lead to the next set of, uh, two books, which is the Half Blood Prince and also the Deathly Hallows and how the story unfolds. This is basically a testament to Rowling's ability to blend fantasy with real human emotions and making it a must read for fans around the world. And I'd like to say over here that in summary, this book is a rollercoaster of emotions at the crucial chapter of the Harry Potter saga and its darker tone and complex themes. It might challenge you, but they'll also enrich the story making it an unforgettable read. And I would definitely recommend all my readers to read this book once, and I'm sure you're going to love it so much that you're going to read it again and again. And finally, I've also shared one of the images from Harry Potter, uh, movie 1. And in this, uh, Harry was playing Quidditch for the first time, and it's it's an amazing snap. I hope you all enjoyed this review. I wanted to keep it short and precise, um, up to, you know, 5 or 6 minutes. I think I've done my job. Uh, let me know whether or not you like this review and how, uh, you would want me to continue with the next set of reviews and on which books I should be reviewing. Thank you so"
